                 Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! - The Console 

This is the first part of a project for Alx software engineering program: AirBnB clone - The console. 

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage the AirBnB objects.

## Description Command Interpreter
The Command Interpreter is used to manage the whole application's functionality from the command line, such as:

-   Crete a new object.
-   Retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.

A command interpreter is the part of a computer operating system that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively by a human being or from a program.

# Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Slimanyy/AirBnB_clone.git
cd AirBnB_clone
```

# How to use the interpreter?
```shell
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
